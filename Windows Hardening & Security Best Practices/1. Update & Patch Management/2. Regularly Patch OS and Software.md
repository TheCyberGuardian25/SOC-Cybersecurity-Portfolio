# Regularly Patch OS and Software
###### After we enable Windows Update, we should set a regular patch schedule for the OS and software to receive security and feature updates and stay up to date.

## Steps on How to Regularly Patch OS and Software

#### Navigate to Windows Update Setting
* Click on **Check for updates** to confirm if there are any available updates. If there are, install them immediately.

###### If you prefer to use PowerShell to check for updates, you can follow these steps:
* Run the following command in PowerShell: **Get-WindowsUpdate**

###### However, if the command does not work, we need to install the PSWindowsUpdate module first.

* Run the command **Install-Module -Name PSWindowsUpdate -Force -SkipPublisherCheck**

* Then, run the **Import-Module PSWindowsUpdate**

###### If this command still does not work, we must allow the script to bypass the restriction, but only for the current PowerShell session.

* Run the command **Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass**
  * *Set-ExecutionPolicy → Changes PowerShell’s rules for running scripts.*
  * *Scope Process → Limits the change to the current PowerShell window only. Once you close the               PowerShell window, it will return to the previous state.*
  * *ExecutionPolicy Bypass → iells PowerShell to ignore script restrictions for that specific session         (so your script or module can run without being blocked).*

* Run the command again **Import-Module PSWindowsUpdate**

* This time, we can successfully run the command **Get-WindowsUpdate**

###### You can choose which method you want to use to update your system—either through Settings or through a PowerShell command. If you choose PowerShell, you can run: *Install-WindowsUpdate -AcceptAll -AutoReboot*. For now, I will use the Settings method.

* To complete the updates, restart the computer.

###### Now, we have successfully installed the security updates for our OS. However, we can see that there is a new version available to install.

* Click **"See what's in this update"** to see what this version includes, or you can access the [link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/inside-this-update-93c5c27c-f96e-43c2-a08e-5812d92f220d?OCID=WUSettings)

###### We have the option to update to the latest version or stay on the current one, as long as the version you are using has not reached End of Service.
###### Note: When upgrading to a new version, you can use PC Health Check to verify whether your system is qualified for the new Windows version.

* Let’s try using PC Health Check to see if we are qualified to use Windows 11.

* As you can see, I received the warning **“This PC doesn’t currently meet Windows 11 system requirements,”** because I am running Windows 11 in VMware using Apple Silicon. The rest of the requirements are met, and the warning is expected because Windows does not officially support ARM on Apple Silicon. However, this warning is harmless, and Windows 11 is running in VMware Fusion as it should.

* Now, our concern is whether we should update to the latest version or not. To check the version of your Windows 11, you can run **wenver**.

* To download the latest version, under the **"Update Windows"** just click the **Download & Install**.

* When it's download, you need to restart it.
