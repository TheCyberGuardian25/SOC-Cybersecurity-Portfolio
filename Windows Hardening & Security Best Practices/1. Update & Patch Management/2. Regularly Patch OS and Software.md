# Regularly Patch OS and Software
###### After we enabled the Windows Update, we should set the patch schedule regularyly for the OS and software for security and feature updates to keep up to date.

## Steps on How to Regularly Patch OS and Software

#### Navigate to Windows Update Setting
* Click on **Check for updates** to ensure if there are no available updates, if there is then install it immediately.

###### If you prefer using the powershell to check for updates, you can do these steps.
* Run on the powershell the command **Get-WindowsUpdate**

###### However, if it's not working the command, we should install first the PSWindowsUpdate module.

* Run the command **Install-Module -Name PSWindowsUpdate -Force -SkipPublisherCheck**

* Then, run the **Import-Module PSWindowsUpdate**

###### If this command isn't working, we should allow the script to bypass the restriction but only in the current PowerShell session.

* Run the command **Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass**
  * *Set-ExecutionPolicy → it changes the PowerShell decisions on whether to run scripts.*
  * *Scope Process → its limiting the changes to the current PowerShell window only. Once you close the        Powershell windows, then,it will be back to the previous state.*
  * *ExecutionPolicy Bypass → it tells PowerShell to ignore script restrictions for that specific session      (so your script or module will bypass the restriction).*

* Run again the command **Import-Module PSWindowsUpdate**

* This time, we can successfully run the command **Get-WindowsUpdate**

###### You have a choice which one you want to use to update your system it's either via Settings or via Powershell command. If you choose via Powershell you can run this command *Install-WindowsUpdate -AcceptAll -AutoReboot*. For now, I want to use via Settings.

* To complete the updates, restart the computer.

###### Now, we successfuly installed the security updates for our OS. However, we can see that there is available version that ready to installed.

###### We have an option if we need to update to the latest version or not as long as the current version that you're using is still not end of service.
