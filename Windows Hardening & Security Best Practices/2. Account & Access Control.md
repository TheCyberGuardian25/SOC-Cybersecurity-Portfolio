# Account & Access Control
It’s important to restrict privileges to minimise risk when there are accounts that are compromised.

#### Step-by-Step Actions:

**1: Implement the least privilege principle**
* Make sure users only have the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
* Remove thos who have administrative rights that they shouldn't have. 

**2: Disable or rename the default Administrator account**
The administrative account is commonly target of the attacker.

**Actions:** 
* Open **Computer Management** (Windows + R find Computer Management or compmgmt.msc).
