# Monitor for Vulnerabilities
There’s no guarantee that after you apply updates and patches, your system will remain safe forever. New vulnerabilities appear constantly, and attackers are always looking for weaknesses in software to exploit. Monitoring ensures that you can respond promptly to new threats before they are exploited.

#### 1. Enable Windows Defender (or a Third-Party Antivirus) for Ongoing Protection
Antivirus and antimalware tools do more than remove existing threats—they also provide real-time monitoring for suspicious activity.

**Actions**:
* Enable and update Windows Defender regularly. Windows automatically updates definitions via Windows Update, but you can also check manually.
* If you prefer a third-party solution, ensure it is reputable, supports real-time monitoring, and is updated frequently.
* Run scheduled scans weekly or monthly to detect dormant malware or misconfigurations.

#### 2. Check Security Advisories
When a vulnerability is discovered, patches may not be released immediately. By monitoring advisories, you can find a list of known vulnerabilities, their severity, and when to apply patches.

**Sources to Monitor:**
* CVE Database (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures): Official listing of vulnerabilities across all software.
* Microsoft Security Bulletins / Microsoft Security Update Guide: For Windows and Microsoft software-specific threats.
* Vendor security advisories for any other software you use (e.g., Adobe, Java, browsers, Linux software).

**Actions:**
* Subscribe to security mailing lists or RSS feeds to receive alerts.
* Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity (Critical, Important, Moderate) and exploitability.
* Check whether installed software is affected and apply the recommended patch or mitigation when necessary.

#### 3. Continuous Improvement
Monitoring is an ongoing task because cybersecurity is continuous.

**Actions:**
* Regularly review installed software versions.
* Apply new patches as soon as they are available.
* Securely log vulnerabilities found and resolved to track your organization’s security posture.
