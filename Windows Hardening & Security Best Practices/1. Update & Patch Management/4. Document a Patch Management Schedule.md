# Document a Patch Management Schedule (Including Third-Party Software)
 ###### BBefore creating a Patch Management Schedule, it’s important to understand the differences between a Patch, an Update, and an Upgrade. This ensures clarity in planning, testing, and applying changes in your environment.

 | Term                             |  Defintion                                     | Example 
 | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------- | 
 Patch | A small fix or modification usually related to bug fixes or security vulnerabilities in software. | Security patches, bug fixes |
 Update | A broader change than a patch; includes security fixes, improvements, minor feature enhancements, and performance adjustments. | Security updates, feature updates and minor improvements. |
 Upgrade | TA major version change that introduces significant new features, interface changes, or performance improvements. Typically requires more planning. | OS upgrades (Windows 10 to 11), Software upgrades (Version 24H2 to version 25H2).

**NOTE:**        
**Patch** - Should be applied immediately, especially for OS-level security vulnerabilities.

**Updates** - May require testing prior to deployment, as updates can sometimes introduce compatibility or stability issues.

**Upgrades** - Usually it requires more manual intervention due to its complexity and might break system configurations or software.
