# Document a Patch Management Schedule (Including Third-Party Software)
 ###### Before we make a Patch Management Schedule let's differentiate first what is the difference between Patch, Update and Upgrade to understand better what we're doing.

 | Term                             |  Defintion                                     | Example 
 | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------- | 
 Patch | It's a small fix or update which is usually related to bugs and security of software vulnerabilities | Security patches, bug fixes |
 Update | The changes is more broader than Patch, it includes security fixes and software improvement. It can be include minor feature enhancements. | Security updates, feature updates and minor improvements. |
 Upgrade | This is a major version change, new significant features, changes or performance improvements. | OS upgrades (Windows 10 to 11), Software upgrades (Version 24H2 to version 25H2).

**NOTE:**        
**Patch** - Should be applied immidiately specially it's for OS security concern

**Updates** - may require some testing before it will apply, as they can sometimes cause                     compatibility issues.

**Upgrades** - usually it needs more manual intervention due to complexity and might breaking system configurations or software.
